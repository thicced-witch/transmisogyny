        <p>
        Trans/Misogyny has two heads. The first head is what we recognize as the intersection of transphobia and misogyny as experienced by trans women, a term first coined by Julia Serano in her 2007 book Whipping Girl. 
The second head is the societal force, Trans/Misogyny. This force creates what we recognize as Gendered Reality, and it's within this reality that all experiences with gender occur.<br/><br/>
Like its sister, Trans/Misogyny is the combined force of transphobia and misogyny.  Misogyny creates the Gender Binary, which is the belief in the imaginary concepts we call Men and Women. In reality, what we recognize as Men and Women are nothing more than shorthand, meant to refer to an arbitrary collection of physical and behavioral traits. Yet due to the effects of misogyny, it’s widely believed that Men and Women are fundamental concepts with as much basis in reality as gravity.
<br/><br/>Through misogyny, the Gender Binary is created, and through transphobia, its existence is maintained. Transphobia stems from the belief that the imaginary concepts of Men and Women are mutually exclusive, and as such, movement from one class to the other is impossible. Transphobia leads its believers to violently police these classes, ensuring that no individual attempts movement from one class to the other.<br/><br/>
These twin forces combine to create Trans/Misogyny, and the force of Trans/Misogyny acting on Objective Reality creates what we recognize as Gendered Reality.
In this space, not only are Men and Women “real”, they have always been real, and will always be real. As such, the logic of Gendered Reality will always affirm our belief in Trans/Misogyny, looping in on itself in service of proving one equation TRUE. The only equation that will always, with 100% certainty, be TRUE within Gendered Reality:
<h1>TRANS/MISOGYNY = TRUE</h1>

        body: `<h1>What Is <br/>Trans/Misogynistic-Bias</h1>
        <p>
        Trans/Misogynistic-Bias is the function through which Trans/Misogyny perpetuates itself.<br/><br/> Biases are cognitive loops, ones created by contradictions within an individual's logic. These loops lead the biased individual towards conclusions which prove the contradiction TRUE, even when it is objectively FALSE. As its name suggests, Trans/Misogynistic-Bias is a cognitive loop created by the contradiction that is Trans/Misogyny.<br/><br/>
The Trans/Misogynistic-Bias loop leads the biased individual towards conclusions which assert that Women and Men are real, as logic which asserts that Women and Men are real will inherently prove that the Gender Binary is real. Since the Gender Binary cannot be real without Trans/Misogyny to sustain it, its existence inherently proves that Trans/Misogyny is real, which then goes on to prove the Gender Binary real.<br/><br/> Trans/Misogyny proves the Gender Binary, which proves Trans/Misogyny in turn. 
This feedback loop is what gives birth to Gendered Reality, and due to this reality's structure being built on trans/misogynistic logic, logic within Gendered Reality will always affirm Trans/Misogynistic-Bias. 
<br/><br/>It's because of this that Trans/Misogyny = TRUE is a universal constant within Gendered Reality, though the simplicity of this equation belies the true nature of Trans/Misogynistic-Bias. Because just as Trans/Misogyny is composed of both transphobia and misogyny, Trans/Misogynistic-Bias is given shape by twin cognitive loops.

    body: `<h1>Passive Bias vs. <br/>Active Bias</h1>
    <p>
    The <b>passive trans/misogynist</b> is someone unaware of their Trans/Misogynistic-Bias.<br/> This occurs when an individual is born into Gendered Reality and becomes normalized to its trans/misogynistic logic. <br/><br/>Due to their lifetime of social conditioning, the passive trans/misogynist automatically reaches conclusions which affirm their <br/>Trans/Misogynistic-Bias.
    <br/><br/>Passive Trans/Misogynists are unaware of this process, but they still possess the ability to recognize trans/misogynistic beliefs, and may even view Trans/Misogyny negatively.<br/><br/> These individuals can memorize conclusions which others have identified as trans/misogynistic, yet they lack the experience necessary to identify the trans/misogynistic thought patterns which lead to these conclusions.
    <br/><br/>The moment a passive trans/misogynist becomes aware of their Trans/Misogynistic-Bias, they cease being passive and become active trans/misogynists.<br/><br/>
The <b>active trans/misogynist</b> is someone aware of their Trans/Misogynistic-Bias. This awareness allows them to engage directly with their bias, identifying beliefs or behavior which are <br/>trans/misogynistic in nature.<br/><br/> While these individuals are aware of their bias, they do not necessarily view the bias negatively. Often it’s the case that the active trans/misogynist finds themself biased in favor of Trans/Misogyny, and recognize trans/misogynistic logic as Objective Logic. 
<br/><br/>Regardless of whether passive or active, <br/>Trans/Misogynistic-Bias will always reach towards the same conclusion;  Affirmation of gender as real, and perpetuation of the class system created by the gender binary.

    body: `<h1>Trans/Misogynistic-Bias <br/>and Classification</h1>
    <p>
        At its core, the Gender Binary–as well as Trans/Misogynistic-Bias–exists to create an oppressed class. This oppressed class is what we recognize as Women, and its oppression is facilitated by the logic of misogynistic-bias, which asserts that women are inherently lesser than those outside of the oppressed class (Women < Men = TRUE). <br/><br/>The creation of an oppressed class carries with it the creation of a non-oppressed class, consisting of those who are not women. This non-oppressed class is what we recognize as Men.
        The classes of Women and Men are defined by the phenomena of femininity and masculinity.<br/><br/> The traits which make up these phenomena differ between cultures, but they can be found in both the physical, such as shape and sound, and the abstract, such as behavior & thought. Trans/Misogynistic-Bias superimposes the classes of Women and Men over these phenomena, so that when traits which evoke femininity or masculinity are identified, the individuals who embody these traits are then classified as either Women or Men.<br/><br/>
        Due to this superimposition, femininity and Women are synonymous within Gendered Reality. As such, traits associated with femininity are subject to the logic of misogynistic-bias. This leads to value neutral qualities such as softness or emotionalism–traits often associated with femininity–to be recognized as lesser. To embody these traits is to embody weakness itself.<br/><br/> Conversely, traits which evoke masculinity become synonymous with strength and power. 
        Further, since Trans/Misogynistic-Bias is perpetually looping in on itself, so too does this conditioning. Just as femininity is associated with weakness, weakness is associated with femininity. <br/><br/>This leads to traits such as helplessness or naivety being viewed as aspects of femininity, while traits which evoke power, such as intelligence and wealth, become aspects of masculinity. Through this process, Trans/Misogynistic-Bias perpetuates the positioning of Women as being less than Men in every aspect.
