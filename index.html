            <h1>Passive Bias vs. <br/>Active Bias</h1>
            <p>
                The <b>passive trans/misogynist</b> is someone unaware of their Trans/Misogynistic-Bias.<br/> This occurs when an individual is born into Gendered Reality and becomes normalized to its trans/misogynistic logic. <br/><br/>Due to their lifetime of social conditioning, the passive trans/misogynist automatically reaches conclusions which affirm their <br/>Trans/Misogynistic-Bias.
                <br/><br/>Passive Trans/Misogynists are unaware of this process, but they still possess the ability to recognize trans/misogynistic beliefs, and may even view Trans/Misogyny negatively.<br/><br/> These individuals can memorize conclusions which others have identified as trans/misogynistic, yet they lack the experience necessary to identify the trans/misogynistic thought patterns which lead to these conclusions.
                <br/><br/>The moment a passive trans/misogynist becomes aware of their Trans/Misogynistic-Bias, they cease being passive and become active trans/misogynists.<br/><br/>
            The <b>active trans/misogynist</b> is someone aware of their Trans/Misogynistic-Bias. This awareness allows them to engage directly with their bias, identifying beliefs or behavior which are <br/>trans/misogynistic in nature.<br/><br/> While these individuals are aware of their bias, they do not necessarily view the bias negatively. Often itâ€™s the case that the active trans/misogynist finds themself biased in favor of Trans/Misogyny, and recognize trans/misogynistic logic as Objective Logic. 
            <br/><br/>Regardless of whether passive or active, <br/>Trans/Misogynistic-Bias will always reach towards the same conclusion;  Affirmation of gender as real, and perpetuation of the class system created by the gender binary.
